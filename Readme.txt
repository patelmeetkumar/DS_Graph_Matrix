For the project 5, I used the adjacency matrix representation
for constructing the graph provided. Java interface and generic 
data type are used.

The zip file should contain the following four files:
Readme.txt
GraphAdjacencyMatrixInterface.java
GraphAdjacencyMatrix.java
TestGraphAdjacencyMatrix.java

To test the code, run the TestGraphAdjacencyMatrix.java file.

Output should be exactly as follows:
